# vimconfig
The vim configuration for my tastes.
Includes the following plugins:
	- Nerdtree
	- vim-javascript (for smarter syntax and indentation)
	- CtrlP
	- Airline

Does some mappings to use NerdTree and CtrlP easily.

Airline is configured to show buffers as tabs on the top, and buffers can be switched with ,l (next) and ,k (previous).
